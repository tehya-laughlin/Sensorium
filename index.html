    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Beginning in the Fall of 2024, Destiny Cool and Tehya Laughlin collaborated to create an art installation aimed at expanding the audience's perspective and understanding. Initially focusing on neurodiversity, they decided to utilize sculpture and videography to convey their message. Mentors and faculty provided guidance throughout the project's development.</p>
    <p>Sensorium centers on the universal sensory experience of the bathroom. While everyone can relate to this environment, individual thresholds for sensory stimuli vary. The installation heightens auditory and visual senses through rapid cuts, evocative sounds, and immersive projections, evoking emotions ranging from panic to eventual calmness as the experience progresses.</p>

    <h2>Sculpture</h2>
    <h3>Weeks 1–3: Testing</h3>
    <p>Tehya gathered materials and completed a small test sculpture to experiment with the planned processes and materials. She also assisted Destiny in capturing video footage, taking on roles such as director, camera operator, and actor.</p>

    <h3>Weeks 4–6: Understructure</h3>
    <p>Tehya constructed the chicken wire understructures for the sculptures and contributed to video production by sourcing free sound samples. Feedback was gathered from mentor Anna Tsouhlarakis during this phase.</p>

    <h3>Weeks 6–8: Paper Mache</h3>
    <p>Paper mache was applied over the chicken wire, followed by a Mod Podge hard coat layer for water sealing. A survey was also created to gather feedback on the project.</p>

    <h2>Video and Projection</h2>
    <h3>Weeks 1–3: Shooting and Early Post-production</h3>
